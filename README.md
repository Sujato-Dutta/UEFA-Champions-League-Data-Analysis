5.	Now, the top clubs by games played were visualized using a bar chart (at least 200).
6.	The data source was now changed to ‘Player Goal Details’ to continue with the visualizations. 
7.	A bar chart was plotted to represent the top 10 players by the no of goals scored in the league’s history.
8.	Then, the data source was changed to ‘Coaches Appear Details’. A bar chart was plotted to represent the top 10 coaches by the most no of appearances in the league’s history.
9.	Lastly, the data source was changed to ‘Player Appear Details’ and a bar chart was plotted to represent the top 10 players by the no of appearances made.
